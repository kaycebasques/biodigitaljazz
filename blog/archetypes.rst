All archetypes and quotes from `The Fifth Discipline`_ by Peter Senge.

----------------
Limits To Growth
----------------

  A reinforcing (amplifying) process is set in motion to produce a desired
  result. It creates a spiral of success but also creates inadvertent
  secondary effects (manifested in a balancing process) which eventually slow
  down the success.

-------------------
Shifting The Burden
-------------------

  An underlying problem generates symptoms that demand attention. But the
  underlying problem is difficult for people to address, either because it
  is obscure or costly to confront. So people "shift the burden" of their
  problem to other solutions â€” well-intentioned, easy fixes which seem
  extremely efficient. Unfortunately, the easier "solutions" only
  ameliorate the symptoms; they leave the underlying problem unaltered.
  The underlying problem grows worse, unnoticed because the symptoms
  apparently clear up, and the system loses whatever abilities it had to
  solve the underlying problem.
