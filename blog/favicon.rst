===================================
Generating random animated favicons
===================================

This blog post is a meandering exploration of a random idea I had while
walking: can I auto-generate a random favicon on every pageview?

Don't know, don't care. I'm doing this for fun. I enjoy encountering new ideas
through the creative process.

Random colors
-------------

To begin, what if I just generate a random color in every pixel? What will that look like?

.. _Rocket: https://rocket.rs
.. _Render: https://render.com

In my first implementation, I generated the favicon server-side. You can see the full
code in :ref:`server` but I quickly realized that this approach wouldn't work. Or at least,
it was sub-optimal. More on that later.

When I eventually got this first implementation working, I was pretty excited
to see the result:

.. raw:: html

   <img id="random_16x16" width="16" height="16"/>

   <script>
     (() => {
       const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
       canvas.width = 16;
       canvas.height = 16;
       const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
       for (let y = 0; y < canvas.height; y++) {
         for (let x = 0; x < canvas.width; x++) {
           const r = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
           const g = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
           const b = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
           ctx.fillStyle = `rgb(${r},${g},${b})`;
           ctx.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1);
         }
       }
       const data = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
       document.querySelector("#random_16x16").src = data;
     })();
   </script>

TV static! A grid of random colors looks like TV static.
Obvious in hindsight, but I did not expect that.

16x16 (the size of a basic favicon) is a little hard to see.
Here's 100x100:

.. raw:: html

   <img id="random_100x100" width="100" height="100"/>

   <script>
     (() => {
       const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
       canvas.width = 100;
       canvas.height = 100;
       const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
       for (let y = 0; y < canvas.height; y++) {
         for (let x = 0; x < canvas.width; x++) {
           const r = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
           const g = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
           const b = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
           ctx.fillStyle = `rgb(${r},${g},${b})`;
           ctx.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1);
         }
       }
       const data = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
       document.querySelector("#random_100x100").src = data;
     })();
   </script>

-----------------------------------------------
Tangential inquiry into the nature of TV static
-----------------------------------------------

What the heck is TV static, anyways? It was one of those things that
just existed in the subconscious of my 90s childhood. I wasn't curious
about technology back then.

Here's a brief description of 90s TV (and static) for my fellow hackers born in
the 2000s and later who have probably never experienced it. Back then, you
couldn't watch whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted. There was a fixed set
of channels, and they played content on a fixed schedule. If you wanted to
watch the new episode of The Simpsons, you had to tune in at 8PM on Sundays.
Other times, you'd just flip through the channels and find something to watch,
like this:

.. raw:: html

   <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XuWInDErrTU"
           style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 560 / 315;"
           title="An example of TV static"
           frameborder="0"
           referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
           allowfullscreen></iframe>

Eventually, you'd hit a channel with no content on it, and see something
like this:

.. raw:: html

   <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_FVFMdiZ0w"
           style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 560 / 315;"
           title="An example of TV static"
           frameborder="0"
           referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
           allowfullscreen></iframe>

That's TV static. So what the heck is it?

It's easier if we start with channels. To the TV, "putting on channel 2" meant
tuning the video receiver to a specific frequency and the audio receiver to
another specific frequency and then outputting the data received at those
specific frequencies.

.. _cosmic microwave background: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background

Now, static. The gist of the phenomenon is that old TVs were always outputting
whatever their audio and video receivers were picking up, and sometimes there
wasn't actually any meaningful data being broadcast over a particular channel.
The TV would therefore be outputting random electromagnetic radiation. The TV
itself generated some of this random electromagnetic radiation. Other
electronic devices generated it, too. And, coolest of all, around 1% of it came
from the `cosmic microwave background`_ generated from the Big Bang!

Sources:

* `The evolution of television <https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Communication/Journalism_and_Mass_Communication/Book%3A_Mass_Communication_Media_and_Culture/09%3A_Television/9.01%3A_The_Evolution_of_Television>`_

* `Analog television <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_television>`_

While doing this research, I realized that TV static was often black and white.
Maybe I had an unusual TV that output static with color, or maybe my memory is
mistaken. I kinda remember that static looked black and white from afar, but if you
got up close, you saw colors. So maybe if I animate the static at a fast rate, use a
lot of pixels, and look at it from afar, it will look black and whiteâ€¦?

-----------------------
Animating the TV static
-----------------------

Once I realized that my random grid of colors looked like a frame of TV static,
my mission became to fully recreate the TV static experience by animating my favicon.
Is that even possible? You would think that browser vendors might not allow it,
because it could potentially be very distracting and annoying. Only one way to
find out!

At this point, I ditched the server-side implementation. I'll probably need tens
of frames of static every millisecond. Going to the network for every frame would
generate a stupid amount of network traffic. There are of course ways to make it work,
but there's no reason for me to be married to server rendering in this silly toy project.

Time for some JavaScript. The basic idea is to render the random colors into
a canvas and then use a data URL to convert that into an image:

.. code-block:: html

   <img id="random_16x16" width="16" height="16"/>

   <script>
     (() => {
       const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
       canvas.width = 16;
       canvas.height = 16;
       const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
       for (let y = 0; y < canvas.height; y++) {
         for (let x = 0; x < canvas.width; x++) {
           const r = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
           const g = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
           const b = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
           ctx.fillStyle = `rgb(${r},${g},${b})`;
           ctx.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1);
         }
       }
       const data = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
       document.querySelector("#random_16x16").src = data;
     })();
   </script>

I tried combining this with ``setInterval`` to generate a new frame
of static every millisecond but it wasn't fast enough. Also, my computer
fan started to sound like a jet engine revving up for takeoff, so I assume
it required a stupid amount of CPU time.

So I started to think about that humble yet fascinating feature of the
web platform known as data URLs. There's something magical about the fact
that I can render an image into a canvas and then convert that into a URL.
What do those data URLs look like? How do they work? Is there a way for me
to just manipulate data URLs directly in order to generate my random frames
of TV static in a way that doesn't require a lot of compute??

-------------------------------------
Journey to the center of the data URL
-------------------------------------

First, let's just generate 10 random frames and log out each frame's data URL
to see if we can spot any obvious patterns:

.. raw:: html

   <button id="generate">Generate</button>
   <div id="laboratory"></div>

   <script>
     (() => {
       const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
       canvas.width = 16;
       canvas.height = 16;
       const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
       const lab = document.querySelector('#laboratory');
       document.querySelector('#generate').addEventListener('click', () => {
         lab.innerHTML = '';
         for (let n = 0; n < 10; n++) {
           for (let y = 0; y < canvas.height; y++) {
             for (let x = 0; x < canvas.width; x++) {
               const r = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
               const g = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
               const b = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
               ctx.fillStyle = `rgb(${r},${g},${b})`;
               ctx.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1);
             }
           }
           const data = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
           lab.innerHTML += `<p>Image ${n + 1}</p>
             <img src="${data}"/>
             <p>Length of data URL: ${data.length}</p>
             <pre style="overflow-x: scroll"><code>${data}</code></pre>
           `;
         }
       });
     })();
   </script>

Patterns:

* The data URLs are usually 1390 characters long, although lengths of 1386, 1394,
  and 1398 also occur sometimes.

* They all start with ``data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAYAAAAf8/9hAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAA``.

I can't see any other obvious patterns. Time to peruse some specs!

* `data: URLs <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data>`_

* `RFC 2397: The "data" URL scheme <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2397>`_

.. _server:

------------------------------------
Appendix: server-side implementation
------------------------------------

In the HTML the favicon was fetched from my web app running on `Render`_:

.. code-block:: html

   â€¦
   <head>
       â€¦
       <link id="favicon" rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="https://biodigitaljazz.onrender.com/favicon.ico">
       â€¦
   </head>
   â€¦

``src/main.rs`` contained a `Rocket`_ web app that handled the favicon generation:

.. code-block:: rs

   // I'm a Rust n00b and I leaned on Gemini and Claude to generate a lot of this
   // code, so it's probably crap (but at least it was working crap!)

   #[macro_use]
   extern crate rocket;
   
   use image::{ImageBuffer, Rgb};
   use rand::prelude::*;
   use rocket::Request;
   use rocket::http::{ContentType, Header, Status};
   use rocket::response::{self, Responder, Response};
   use std::io::Cursor;
   
   pub struct Favicon<R>(pub R);
  
   // For anything beyond super basic responses it seems like you need
   // to implement one of these responder things? It felt pretty
   // convoluted, IMOâ€¦
   impl<'r, 'o: 'r, R: Responder<'r, 'o>> Responder<'r, 'o> for Favicon<R> {
       fn respond_to(self, req: &'r Request<'_>) -> response::Result<'o> {
           Response::build_from(self.0.respond_to(req)?)
               .header(Header::new(
                   "Cache-Control",
                   "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate",
               ))
               .header(Header::new("Pragma", "no-cache"))
               .header(Header::new("Expires", "0"))
               .header(Header::new(
                   "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
                   "https://biodigitaljazz.net",
               ))
               .ok()
       }
   }
   
   fn generate_favicon() -> Result<Vec<u8>, image::ImageError> {
       let mut rng = rand::rng();
       let mut img = ImageBuffer::new(16, 16);
       for (_, _, pixel) in img.enumerate_pixels_mut() {
           let r: u8 = rng.random::<u8>();
           let g: u8 = rng.random::<u8>();
           let b: u8 = rng.random::<u8>();
           *pixel = Rgb([r, g, b]);
       }
       let mut buffer = Cursor::new(Vec::new());
       img.write_to(&mut buffer, image::ImageFormat::Ico)?;
       Ok(buffer.into_inner())
   }
   
   #[get("/favicon.ico")]
   fn get_favicon() -> Result<Favicon<(Status, (ContentType, Vec<u8>))>, Status> {
       match generate_favicon() {
           Ok(image_data) => Ok(Favicon((Status::Ok, (ContentType::Icon, image_data)))),
           Err(_) => Err(Status::InternalServerError),
       }
   }
   
   #[launch]
   fn rocket() -> _ {
       rocket::build().mount("/", routes![get_favicon])
   }

``Cargo.toml`` for completeness:

   name = "biodigitaljazz"
   edition = "2024"
   version = "0.0.0"
   publish = false

   [dependencies]

   rand = "0.9.0"
   image = { version = "0.25.5", features = ["ico"] }

As well as ``Rocket.toml``:

   [default]
   address = "0.0.0.0"
   port = 10000

Notes on my experience:

* Render is nice. It's basically a Heroku that's not stuck in 2010.
* I've heard that Rust has a reputation of making simple things difficult.
  Boy, did it live it up to that reputation here. In Python or Node.js I
  would be able to get this running in 10-20 minutes, whereas with Rust it
  was more like 2-3 hours.
* Rocket's incomplete docs didn't help matters, either. E.g. there's no guidance
  on serving images or configuring CORS.
