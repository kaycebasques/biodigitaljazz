Not the laptop I need but the one I deserve (and also need)

Next week Gabi and I head off to Japan for a 3-week vacation. The
`god of electronics`_ has blessed me with the motivation to tinker
during my flights. I'm in a bit of a pickle, though... what laptop
should I bring?

* I don't want to bring my work laptop. It's too big and I want to practice
  some "healthy detachment" from work. And by "healthy detachment" I mean
  "I need to put this computer into a barrel of sand because I somehow
  programmed "Hello, world!" in Haskell so incorrectly that the battery
  is about to explode."
* I don't have a lightweight personal laptop that's enjoyable to goof around
  on.

The solution for me, naturally, was to spend too much money on a highly
questionable Raspberry Pi "laptop".

"laptop"

The official name of this product is `CrowPi-L`_ but mine only answers to the
moniker of `pCrowDoodle my beloved`_.

pCrowDoodle is best thought of as the computational equivalent of
`Armadillo: Opossum Heavy Armor`_:

You just lift the magnetically attached (??) back cover...

...and cram your RPi into the corner...

...and your basically ready to fire pCrowDoodle up and realize that the boot
firmware is surely impossible to update and probably backdoor'd:

Form factor: wedgebot

Cramming the RPi into the back results in a slope steep enough to downhill
race on:

`Wheely Big Cheese`_ is dead, long live Wheely Big Cheese!

-----------------------------------
Dual boot: quite pleasant, actually
-----------------------------------
pCrowDoodle came with a little SD expansion thingy that lets you switch
between an "A" SD card and a "B" SD card quickly:

I'm tempted to flip it while my RPi is running just to learn how much or little
damage that does...

RPi OS booted up pretty much without a hitch:

And I even got OpenBSD working on the other SD!

Pretty excited about that. I'm going to leave it as a purely console-based
experience.

Unusable trackpad: a blessing in disguise
-----------------------------------------
The trackpad is comically small and has already started to freeze up on me:

But I knew this going into the purchase and didn't care. I've been meaning
to get really good at keyboard-based navigation so I'm kinda excited to
have something that takes away my crutch.

`Lobsters <https://lobste.rs>`_ on ``lynx`` somehow looks better than the
actual website??

40-pin GPIO header
------------------
You need a connector (which was annoyingly not included with my purchase)
but it's still possible to access all the pins:

The laptop I deserve
--------------------
As an irrational simpleton I am oddly excited for my future struggles
that arise from this decision. I will report back after the trip.
