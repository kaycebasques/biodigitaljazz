Axioms of Systemantics - how systems work and why they fail
===========================================================

*2024 Jan 25*

`Systemantics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemantics>`__ is a silly little
book by John Gall with some interesting ideas about how systems (barely) work and why they fail. Below is
a summary of the book's axioms.

(The sentences in bold are mostly verbatim from the book; I edited a few.
Sentences in quotes are also from the book. Everything else is my own.)

**Systems In General Work Poorly Or Not At All**. There is no single, hidden
defect that's preventing your complex system from working; failure to function
as expected is an intrinsic feature of complex systems. In the beginning the
Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely
regarded as a bad move.

**New Systems Mean New Problems**. Back when I was content lead for
`web.dev <https://web.dev>`_ I set up an automated form to take in new content
proposals. The automation itself would break. Some teammates were unhappy with
the new bureaucracy. When I left that role ownership of the automated form
didn't transfer correctly. Etc.

.. _clonal anergy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonal_anergy
.. _The Macro Tourist: https://markethuddle.com/welcome/episodes/

**The Total Amount Of Anergy In The Universe Is Constant**. Gall defines anergy
as the negative of energy. See also `clonal anergy`_. "The sum total of
problems facing the community has not changed. They have merely changed their
form and relative importance." I've heard `The Macro Tourist`_ talk about risk
in similar terms.

**Systems Tend To Grow And Encroach**. "A striking example is the
"do-it-yourself" movement, instigated by managers of mass production in the
world to *make the consumer do some of the work the system is supposed to do*.
The consumer is encouraged to do the work of assembling the parts of the
product he has bought on the bizarre grounds that it "saves so much work and
expense". Several hours later, the exasperated purchaser may recall that the
system of mass production was set up in the first place because such functions
can be more cheaply and rapidly done under factory conditions."

**Complicated Systems Produce Unexpected Outcomes**. DDT was introduced to
improve crop yield and control disease and ended up dangerously thinning out
the shells of Bald Eagles.

**Complex Systems Tend To Oppose Their Own Proper Function**. My favorite
axiom. Your city has a problem with trash building up on the streets so it
sets up a waste management company. The company starts out by collecting trash
daily, but then they shift to a Tuesday-only schedule. Next, you get a notice
saying that the company will no longer service your building unless you buy
their standardized garbage cans (to ensure that the robotic arms on their
trucks can pick them up). Eventually, the waste management union goes on strike
and the trash starts piling up on the street again anyways.

**People In Systems Do Not Do What The System Says They Are Doing**. The
stated purpose of a king is to rule a country, but in reality they spend a lot
of time fighting off usurpers.

**The System Itself Does Not Do What It Says It Is Doing**. "*Example 1*.
Doesn't the auto industry supply us with millions of new cars each year, even
tailoring them to our changing tastes in style and performance? *Answer*. The
reason we think the auto industry is meeting our needs is that we have almost
completely forgotten what we originally wanted, namely, a means of going from
one place to another that would be cheap, easy, convenient, safe, and fast."

**The Real World Is Whatever Is Reported To The System**. "People in systems
are never dealing with the real world that the rest of us have to live in but
with a filtered, distorted, and censored version which is all that can get past
the sensory organs of the system itself."

**For Every Human System, There Is A Type Of Person Adapted To Thrive On It**.
There are some attributes that are probably necessary for survival in any
system, but each system has some uniqueness in the sense that it attracts
different traits. It's hard to tell what traits any given system attracts. The
traits do not necessarily align with successful operation of the system itself
e.g. the qualities for being elected president don't necessarily align with the
ability to run the country effectively. Systems not only attract people who
will succeed within the system but also people with parasitic traits that
thrive at the expense of the system. "Efforts to remove parasitic
Systems-people by means of screening committees, review boards, and competency
examinations merely generate new job categories for such people to occupy."

**The Bigger The System, The Narrower And More Specialized The Interface
With Individuals**. To the US tax system, the concept of "social security
number" is (probably) more important than the concept of "person".

**A Complex System Cannot Be "Made" To Work**. Attempting "a good swift kick"
may improve functioning for a moment but usually results in total
nonfunctioning.

**A Simple System, Designed From Scratch, Sometimes Works**.

**Some Complex Systems Actually Work**.

**A Complex System That Works Is Invariably Found To Have Evolved From A
Simple System That Works**. "The mechanism by which the transition from
*working simple system* to *working complex system* takes place is not known.
Few areas offer greater potential reward for truly first-rate research."

**A Complex System Designed From Scratch Never Works**. The League Of Nations.

**In Complex Systems, Malfunction And Total Nonfunction May Not Be Detectable
For Long Periods, If Ever**. "It would seem reasonable to suppose that...
governments in which all power is concentrated in the will of one man would
require as a minimum for the adequate functioning of those governments, that
the will of the despot be intact. Nevertheless, the list of absolute monarchs
who were hopelessly incompotent, even insane, is surprisingly long. They ruled
with utter caprice... for decades on end, and the net result to their countries
was---undetectably different from the rule of the wisest kings."

**Large Complex Systems Are Beyond Human Capacity To Evaluate**. It's difficult
to know what a large, complex system is doing, and therefore it's difficult to
judge it as a success or failure.

.. _Selective Service System: https://www.sss.gov/register/why-is-selective-service-important/

**A System Continues To Do Its Thing, Regardless Of Need**. The
`Selective Service System`_ continues to require all 18-year-old male US
citizens to register for the draft, even though the US hasn't had a draft
in 51 years.

**Systems Develop Goals Of Their Own**.

**Intrasystem Goals Come First**.

**Complex Systems Usually Operate In Failure Mode**. Poke around any complex
system and will you find sub-systems that seem to solve a particular problem
but on closer investigation are found to not actually be working.

**The Mode Of Failure From A Complex System Cannot Ordinarily Be Predicted
From Its Structure**. When you go back and trace the actual financial
mechanisms that failed in the 2008 and 2020 financial crises... it gets pretty
weird.

**The Crucial Variables Are Discovered By Accident**.

**The Larger The System, The Greater The Probability Of Unexpected Failure**.

**"Success" Or "Failure" In Any System May Be Failure In The Larger Or Smaller
Systems To Which The System Is Connected**.

**When A Fail-Safe System Fails, It Fails By Failing To Fail Safe**.

**Complex Systems Tend To Produce Complex Responses (Not Solutions) To
Problems**. 

**Great Advances Are Not Produced By Systems Designed To Produce Great
Advances**. "A system that is sufficiently large, complex, and ambitious can
reduce output far below "random" levels. Thus, a federal Program to conquer
cancer may tie up all the competent researchers in the field, leaving the
problem to be solved by someone else, typically a graduate student from the
University of Tasmania doing a little recreational entomology on his vacation.
*Solutions usually come from people who see in the problem only an interesting
puzzle, and whose qualifications would never satisfy a select committee.*"

**Systems Opposing Human Motivation Work Poorly Or Not At All**.

**Loose Systems Last Longer And Work Better**.
