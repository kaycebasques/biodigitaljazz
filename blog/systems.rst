Books about systems
===================

*2024 Jan 23*

Books I've read:

* `Systemantics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemantics>`_. Highly
  recommend. This is "chicken soup for the system thinker's soul". The third
  edition is called *The Systems Bible*.
* `Thinking In Systems <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_In_Systems:_A_Primer>`_.
  Highly recommend. This is probably the best formal introduction to systems
  thinking out there.
* `The Fifth Discipline <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Discipline>`_.
  Do not recommend. At least, not if "systems thinking" is your goal. Only 1
  of the 4 or 5 parts is dedicated to systems thinking. The rest is business
  leadership stuff.

Books on my radar:

* `Reckoning With Risk <https://www.amazon.com/0140297863>`_
* `Doing It Differently <https://www.amazon.com/0727760823>`_
