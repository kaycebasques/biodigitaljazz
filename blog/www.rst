The ``www`` in ``www.biodigitaljazz.net``

*2023 Nov 25*

The ``www`` in ``https://www.biodigitaljazz.net`` means that you're now surfing
the world wide web. This is how people in the 90s talked. Those were simpler
times. No one was worried about the fact that "surfing the web" is a mixed
metaphor. Anyways, I wanted the domain for this site to just be
``https://biodigitaljazz.net`` but I couldn't figure out how to get the
DNS working. So let's just all pretend that I intentionally chose the ``www``
in the domain name as a form of 90s nostalgia.
