Adventures in {hard,soft,wet}ware by `Kayce Basques <https://kayce.basqu.es>`_

Read yourself a thing on the :ref:`blog`

The ``www`` in ``https://www.biodigitaljazz.net`` means that you're now surfing
the world wide web. This is how people in the 90s talked. Those were simpler
times. No one was worried about the fact that "surfing" the "web" is a mixed
metaphor. Anyways, I wanted the domain for this site to just be
``https://biodigitaljazz.net`` but I couldn't figure out how to get the
DNS working so let's just all pretend that I intentionally chose the ``www``
in the domain name as a form of 90s nostalgia.
