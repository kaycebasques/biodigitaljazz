UART connection to RPi

GND to pin 6
RPi TX to pin 8 (laptop receives data from RPi over this line)
RPi RX to pin 10 (laptop sends data to RPi over this line)

minicom -s
serial port setup

A - serial device = /dev/ttyUSB0 (for me)
E - Bps/Par/Bits = 115200 8N1
F - hardware flow control = no (TX from laptop to RPi won't work if this is wrong)
G - software flow control = no (probably also important)
(press enter to exit that screen)
select Exit to finish setup and go to main minicom screen


there's openbsd info here but it was TMI for me
