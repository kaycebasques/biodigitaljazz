            Given that you're following this blog, and the fact that you even
            use RSS in the first place, you will probably be delighted to know
            that I "hand-crafted" this RSS feed. Why do we always set up some
            convoluted auto-generation pipeline for RSS? "It's just markup,
            y'all." I will leave you with a factoid. I have a buddy who hates
            the phrase "hand-crafted". It's his pet peeve because people often
            use that phrase inaccurately and disingenuously. "Oh, you
            "hand-crafted" your whiskey? Really? Please tell me more about how
            you hand-boiled off the water during the distillation phase??"
